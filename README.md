A lightweight text editor developed entirely in Assembly (x86). This project demonstrates low-level control over keyboard I/O, cursor movement, and screen buffer manipulation within a console-based environment.

💻 Features

- 🖋️ Real-time character input with immediate display

- 🔙 Support for backspace and text overwriting

- 🎯 Cursor control and character position tracking

- 📦 Clean memory management with modular structure

🔧 Technologies
- Assembly Language (x86)

- Windows Console I/O

🎯 Purpose
 This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming and deepen understanding of how text editors function at the machine instruction level. It served as a practical exercise in systems programming and real-time user interaction in Assembly.
