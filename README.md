# 🧠 Assembly Text Editor

A lightweight console-based text editor written entirely in **x86 Assembly**. This project demonstrates how low-level programs can interact directly with hardware to handle keyboard input, screen output, and cursor movement — all without the help of a high-level language or standard library.

## 🧩 Motivation

While most text editors are built using high-level programming languages and modern GUI frameworks, this project takes a deep dive into how such software can be implemented at the machine level. It was designed to explore system-level programming concepts and offer hands-on experience with hardware interaction, memory management, and real-time input processing in Assembly.
